## About The India Today Group

### The India Today Group is India's most respected and diversified media conglomerate that has created an enviable legacy of trust, credibility and admiration since the Group's inception over four decades ago. The launch of the India Today magazine in 1975 started the Group’s journey into a multi brand, multi-platform and multi-vertical media group, with brands that command undisputed leadership across categories and reach out to more than 30 crore viewers, readers, listeners, and subscribers. The Group, through its years of consistent focus on journalistic and editorial excellence, has become the epitome of the Gold Standard of Journalism. It is the barometer for trust, integrity and excellence in media across TV, Publishing, Digital and other platforms.

### India Today Media Institute’s birth in 2005 was a result of the India Today Group recognizing the dearth of industry-ready, skilled talent in broadcast journalism. True to its original identity, ITMI maintains focus on a careful marriage of skill development with responsible theoretical foundation, so that our graduates are job-ready in both conceptual and practical terms.

### As ITMI has expanded its footprint and offerings, it has adopted a three-pronged approach to its highly personalized teaching approach—to build in students the values that the media industry requires from its professionals: Learnability, Worldview, and Employability.

### Few people truly understand the need for quality education in media and communication as those who run the industry. That is why ITMI, run by one of India’s largest media groups, offers more than what any other academic college can. We pride ourselves on our natural and developed advantages: Access to state-of-the-art media technology; learning from some of the best minds; unparalleled exposure to the world’s top professionals, thinkers, nation-builders and lawmakers; and finally, our serious emphasis on employability, providing unparalleled job opportunities both within the India Today Group and in the media and communication industries nationally.

### ITMI could not have been founded on firmer grounding. The India Today Group's strength of understanding and delivering high-quality matter has not only rubbed off on the institute, we carry the torch further by making a difference to the profession as a whole.
